A California man who pleaded guilty to attacking anti-racism protesters at a white nationalist rally and at a torch-lit march through the University of Virginia’s campus will avoid serving a term in federal prison.

U.S. District Judge Norman Moon on Friday sentenced Cole Evan White, 26, of Clayton, California, to 14 months in prison but gave him credit for seven months he served in jail after his arrest and five months of home confinement. That leaves two more months of house arrest followed by two years of supervised release.

White was one of four members or associates of a white supremacist group called Rise Above Movement who were charged with conspiring to riot at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Moon previously sentenced White’s three co-defendants to between two and three years in prison.

A prosecutor said White deserves a more lenient sentence because he immediately cooperated with authorities, disavowed the hateful ideology that led him to participate in the Charlottesville violence and provided substantial assistance in this and a separate investigation.

White said he is ashamed of his actions but used his time in jail to make himself a better person.

“My foolish actions caused me to be confined to a small cell for 23 hours a day, resulting in the loss of many relationships,” he said. “Words cannot express the guilt and embarrassment I have for being part of something so destructive.”

Video footage captured White head-butting a clergyman and a woman, bloodying her face, during the confrontations between far-right extremists and counterprotesters on the streets of Charlottesville, according to an FBI task force member’s affidavit. The violence culminated with an avowed neo-Nazi, James Fields, deliberately ramming his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a woman.

As part of his guilty plea, White admitted that he struck people with a torch during the march through the University of Virginia’s campus on the night before the rally. Torch-bearers chanted anti-Semitic slogans, such as “Jews will not replace us!” before surrounding and attacking students and other counterprotesters.

White also acknowledged that he joined members of the now-defunct Rise Above Movement at an April 2017 political rally on the streets of downtown Berkeley, California, where he punched protesters in the head. White befriended one of the group’s members at the Berkeley rally. Members of the California-based Rise Above Movement, or “RAM” for short, frequently posted photographs and videos of themselves engaging in mixed martial arts street-fighting techniques.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Kavanaugh recommended a prison sentence ranging from 12 to 18 months but said prosecutors aren’t opposed to letting White complete his sentence on community confinement or home detention since he already was incarcerated for more than seven months.

“He fully and entirely accepted responsibility,” Kavanaugh said.

Kavanaugh said White had agreed to testify against his co-defendants as well as a Florida man who was charged separately with waging an online campaign to terrorize and harass those who opposed his white supremacist ideology. Daniel McMahon, 32, of Brandon, Florida , pleaded guilty in April to using social media to threaten a Black activist to deter the man from running for office in Charlottesville and was sentenced in August to three years and five months in prison.

Kavanaugh said White could have helped prosecutors prove that McMahon’s call for using a “diversity of tactics” against the Black activist, Don Gathers, was a euphemism for violence. “Cole White was familiar with the ideology that was used by white supremacists and people online and knew the context surrounding that phrase,” the prosecutor said.

Last week, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reconsider an appeal by two of White’s co-defendants. A three-judge panel rejected the two men’s arguments that the Anti-Riot Act, the law they pleaded guilty to violating, is unconstitutionally vague under the First Amendment’s free speech clause.

Benjamin Daley, 27, of Torrance, California, was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Thomas Gillen, 26, of Redondo Beach, California, received a sentence of 33 months. Michael Miselis, 31, of Lawndale, California, was sentenced to 27 months.

Miselis was released from federal custody on Sept. 2, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Gillen is due to be released in February 2021. Daley is scheduled for release in May 2021.

White has attended San Francisco State University since a federal magistrate agreed to free him from jail in May 2019, according to defense attorney Michael Hemenway. White was detained for more than seven months between his October 2018 arrest and his release on $10,000 bond.

University spokesman Kent Bravo said in an email Monday that White is a part-time student who first enrolled in the fall 2017 semester, which started less than a month after the Charlottesville rally. Bravo said the admissions process for San Francisco State and other schools in the California State University system does not ask applicants about their criminal background.

“San Francisco State University unequivocally condemns white supremacy,” Bravo said in a statement. “We send our compassion and concern to those affected by the events of that tragic weekend, specifically the victims and families of those who were targeted by individuals motivated by hate.”",['https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-virginia-california-charlottesville-prisons-ff272864758dff4c10b3656d06d3a539'],37.8723,-122.27600000000001

Fredrick James, 34 of Decatur, Georgia, was charged on Saturday with aggravated assault and reckless conduct.

A group of 30 to 40 demonstrators were lying in the intersection in front of City Hall blocking traffic in protest of the death of Breonna Taylor on Sunday evening when James drove up to the area and threw the grenade, the Savannah Police Department said in a news release.

Some protesters fled, while others struck his vehicle. James then exited the vehicle and drew his firearm, police said.

When officers arrived no one was at the scene, however James was located a short time later.

jbva8w,Washington,Seattle,2020-10-15 18:43:12+00:00,Detective who appeared to mock Seattle protesters hit by car faces possible termination,"A King County Sheriff's Office detective in Washington state faces possible termination over offensive Facebook posts, including one where he appeared to mock a Seattle protester who was killed and another who was injured after they were hit by a car.

The detective, Mike Brown, was placed on leave in July and an internal investigation was launched over the social media posts. One image posted on July 4 showed a vehicle hitting a group of people with the caption ""All lives splatter"" and ""Keep your (expletive) off the road.""

Earlier that day, Summer Taylor, 24, and Diaz Love, 32, were hit by a car after a vehicle drove onto an interstate that had been closed for protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

Taylor, from Seattle, was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and later died. Love, from Bellingham, was hospitalized in serious condition.

The driver, Dawit Kelete, 27, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, according to the Associated Press.

The sheriff's office said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the investigation into the detective's posts was complete and undersheriff Patti Cole-Tindall ""is recommending Detective Brown’s employment at KCSO be terminated.""

The office says Brown now has a right to a meeting with Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht, who will make the ultimate decision about disciplinary action — including termination. KCSO and Brown's union representatives have yet to schedule that meeting.

Cole-Tindall said in a memo that the department received hundreds of complaints after Brown's July 4 post and the investigation uncovered seven other offensive posts and messages.

""The blow to the department’s integrity was staggering. The damage to your integrity and ability to continue to serve as a law enforcement officer cannot be repaired,"" Cole-Tindall wrote.

According to the investigative report from KCSO, seen by NBC News, Brown posted a comment on his July 4 post writing, “I see a couple of people got infected with Covid-19 from the hood of a car on I-5 last night."" And in June, he posted a video showing an officer in Baltimore punching a Black woman after she punched his partner. He captioned the video, ""When in doubt... Knock em out,"" the file shows.

Another post included a video of a movie clip showing an officer shooting people. Brown captioned it, “Here they come CHOP CHAZ,"" referring to Seattle's Capitol Hill Occupied Protest Zone, which was formed in June by demonstrators protesting police brutality and the death of Floyd.

The zone, formerly known as CHAZ, became a self-sufficient community after the Seattle Police Department vacated the East Precinct. In late June, Mayor Jenny Durkan ordered officers to clear out demonstrators following a string of shootings within the zone.

During an interview with an investigator, Brown said he did not know that his posts were offensive and said he posted the meme on July 4 because it reminded him of his father who had recently passed away.

Brown told an investigator that when he was a child, his dad would tell him to ""go play in the freeway"" whenever he got mad, according to a transcript that was included in the report. The detective said he didn't make the connection between ""All lives splatter"" and ""Black Lives Matter.""

""And so that's what I was thinking, along those lines. I wasn't thinking along the lines of making light of it or making light of the movement,"" he said.

""My perception of it at the time was that you go on the freeway at 1:30 in the morning, bad things are going to happen and that's what I was looking at,"" he continued. ""Like, 'Well, if you hadn't been on the freeway, you would have been okay.'

Cole-Tindall wrote in her memo that his comments were ""extremely insensitive to the victims of a suspected serious vehicular assault.""

Brown, who has been employed with the department for over 40 years, and the King County Police Officers Guild could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.",['https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/detective-who-appeared-mock-seattle-protesters-hit-car-faces-possible-n1243544'],47.6211,-122.3244
jc3s6l,Louisiana,New Orleans,2020-10-15 00:00:00,Someone called the police on a ‘homeless Jesus’ statue,"There are films to approach with a sense of awe and humility, films in which the images seem to be no mere representations of life but immediately and vulnerably alive themselves. Garrett Bradley’s documentary “Time” (which appears on Amazon, on Friday) is one such film. What’s missing from most movies is the feeling that they’re necessary—that the filmmakers are presenting events that matter to them personally, and creating images with any sense of personal urgency. “Time,” by contrast, is a film that virtually shrieks with a sense of emergency, of direst need, from the very start—and it’s a need that quickly leaps out from the lives and experiences of the people on-camera to illuminate and challenge the ongoing horrors of American history in the present tense.

Though Bradley is credited as the director, much of the footage in the movie wasn’t shot by her. Rather, it was made by the movie’s principal subject, Sibil Fox Richardson, a.k.a. Fox Rich, in the course of nearly twenty years prior to Bradley’s involvement with her. Fox Richardson and her husband, Robert Richardson—who are Black—owned, in the nineteen-nineties, a hip-hop clothing store in Shreveport, Louisiana. When it was in danger of going out of business, the couple took part in a bank robbery and were arrested. Sibil pleaded guilty, was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment, and was released after three and a half. Robert, who went to trial, was sentenced, unconscionably, to sixty years without parole. Upon her release, Sibil began to videotape herself and their six children, all sons, in an act of devotion and faith. She was preserving for Robert as much as she could of the time that he missed, and she was doing so on the premise that, despite the seemingly ironclad sentence, he would be released early—because she was working relentlessly on his behalf, in legal efforts that she videotaped as well.

Nearly two decades into Robert’s sentence—when the youngest of the Richardson children were already grown—Bradley joined forces with Sibil to document both the family’s great occasions (one son graduates from dental school; another, in college, becomes an elected officer in school and plans a career in criminal-justice reform) and Sibil’s persistent, diligent, carefully planned work petitioning judges to seek Robert’s release. Sibil has also become an activist on behalf of prison abolition—she speaks frankly of it as a new form of slavery and considers herself an abolitionist, and she makes her case with passionate reason in public forums throughout the region. Both to support the family and to finance Robert’s very expensive legal proceedings, Sibil moved the family to New Orleans and became a successful businessperson, as the owner of a car dealership. Through it all, she uninhibitedly affirms—and demonstrates—her fierce love for Robert.

The agonizing yet majestic particulars of the Richardsons’ lives are brought together in a deft, freely associative montage (the film was edited by Gabriel Rhodes) that, true to the title, evokes time—its passage moment by moment, the power and the pain of memory, the keen sense of loss that it brings, and, above all, the feeling that the time a person has is the substance of life. What “Time” depicts, in showing the effects of the deprivation of time, is a sort of living death, a deprivation that eats away at one’s emotional and material core. There is no biological death in the course of the film; the story of the Richardsons isn’t one of wrongful killing. Yet theirs is a story of violence nonetheless, the ambient threat of oblivion that’s exemplified and embodied in the carceral regime and its grossly disproportionate impact on Black Americans. “Time” depicts the ordinary, day-to-day activities of the Richardson family—Sibil’s appearance in a commercial for her company, her children’s successes in school and playful leisure, family outings and celebrations—and also how those activities are rendered bitterly, arduously, yet heroically extraordinary by the sheer burden that institutional racism imposes on them.

Sibil is well aware of the folly and the wrong of the crime that she and Robert committed, and there’s a deeply moving sequence in which she speaks to her church congregation of her remorse, her meetings with women who were victims of the robbery, and the wise counsel that one of them offered. Yet she also details the depravities of incarceration, which lead her to question and challenge pat slogans and unchallenged assumptions of the penal system. A sublime orator on the public stage of meeting halls and churches, Sibil also invests her day-to-day conversation and her cinematic monologues (on-camera and in voice-over) with a finely rhetorical exaltation that resounds with a mighty sense of purpose. (Remarkably, most of the film’s music reinforces that devoutly exalted mood: it features piano works composed and performed by the Ethiopian composer—and nun—Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou, born in 1923 and now living in Jerusalem, which she recorded in the nineteen-sixties.)

Bradley renders all of the film’s footage in black-and-white, abstracting it somewhat from the incidentals and emphasizing the overarching, unifying themes, emotions, and ideas. The entire family (and, for that matter, extended family, including Sibil’s mother, who speaks with a quietly oracular voice) are present throughout, but it’s Sibil’s presence and voice that dominate the film. “Time” is a sort of collective autobiography, a story of a family that is both unhappy in a way that many families, many Black families, are unhappy, and happy in its own way, because of its fierce devotion to remaining together—and to fighting for the shared cause of its unity, its reunification. For decades, Sibil and the family have lived both with an evident sense of daily achievement and also with a sense of abeyance, of suspended animation that awaits Robert’s release and return. Sibil films herself with a keenly self-conscious sense of moment; she transforms the ordinary and humble home video to monumental dimensions, and Bradley (working with the cinematographers Zac Manuel, Justin Zweifach, and Nisa East) conveys the same urgency in Sibil’s presence. The result isn’t to turn daily life into performance; it is, rather, a sanctification, the placing of a divine weight, a community responsibility, and a cosmic value on the expressions and gestures and activities of daily life—and to attempt to live in a way that honors the responsibility and the pressure that circumstances demand.

Watching “Time,” I found myself wanting to know more—to know anything—about the relationship between Bradley and Sibil (and the Richardson family) that provides the premise for the film. For instance, press notes mention that the project was conceived as a short film, and that Bradley didn’t know of Sibil’s videotapes until after filming was done—it was only then, after Sibil provided her with the family’s video archive, that the director decided to expand the project to feature length. (Sibil, who created much of the footage that’s seen in the film, is, in effect, the uncredited co-director.) The occasional, if rare, deference to documentary conventions (such as fadeouts of speech in montage sequences) briefly break the film’s mood of elevated fervor and provide a not altogether welcome reminder of the informational establishment from which the film (produced by the New York Times) emerges. Yet Bradley’s self-elision comes off (as such self-omissions seldom do) as an act of cinematic humility before the enormity of the story that she was transmitting, and before the grandeur of Sibil’s journey and quest.",['https://kensingtonkettle.com/2020/10/15/someone-called-the-police-on-a-homeless-jesus-statue/'],30.0687,-89.9288
