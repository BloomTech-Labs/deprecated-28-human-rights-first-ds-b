jbva8w,Washington,Seattle,2020-10-15 18:43:12+00:00,Detective who appeared to mock Seattle protesters hit by car faces possible termination,"A King County Sheriff's Office detective in Washington state faces possible termination over offensive Facebook posts, including one where he appeared to mock a Seattle protester who was killed and another who was injured after they were hit by a car.

The detective, Mike Brown, was placed on leave in July and an internal investigation was launched over the social media posts. One image posted on July 4 showed a vehicle hitting a group of people with the caption ""All lives splatter"" and ""Keep your (expletive) off the road.""

Earlier that day, Summer Taylor, 24, and Diaz Love, 32, were hit by a car after a vehicle drove onto an interstate that had been closed for protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

Taylor, from Seattle, was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and later died. Love, from Bellingham, was hospitalized in serious condition.

The driver, Dawit Kelete, 27, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, according to the Associated Press.

The sheriff's office said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the investigation into the detective's posts was complete and undersheriff Patti Cole-Tindall ""is recommending Detective Brown’s employment at KCSO be terminated.""

The office says Brown now has a right to a meeting with Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht, who will make the ultimate decision about disciplinary action — including termination. KCSO and Brown's union representatives have yet to schedule that meeting.

Cole-Tindall said in a memo that the department received hundreds of complaints after Brown's July 4 post and the investigation uncovered seven other offensive posts and messages.

""The blow to the department’s integrity was staggering. The damage to your integrity and ability to continue to serve as a law enforcement officer cannot be repaired,"" Cole-Tindall wrote.

According to the investigative report from KCSO, seen by NBC News, Brown posted a comment on his July 4 post writing, “I see a couple of people got infected with Covid-19 from the hood of a car on I-5 last night."" And in June, he posted a video showing an officer in Baltimore punching a Black woman after she punched his partner. He captioned the video, ""When in doubt... Knock em out,"" the file shows.

Another post included a video of a movie clip showing an officer shooting people. Brown captioned it, “Here they come CHOP CHAZ,"" referring to Seattle's Capitol Hill Occupied Protest Zone, which was formed in June by demonstrators protesting police brutality and the death of Floyd.

The zone, formerly known as CHAZ, became a self-sufficient community after the Seattle Police Department vacated the East Precinct. In late June, Mayor Jenny Durkan ordered officers to clear out demonstrators following a string of shootings within the zone.

During an interview with an investigator, Brown said he did not know that his posts were offensive and said he posted the meme on July 4 because it reminded him of his father who had recently passed away.

Brown told an investigator that when he was a child, his dad would tell him to ""go play in the freeway"" whenever he got mad, according to a transcript that was included in the report. The detective said he didn't make the connection between ""All lives splatter"" and ""Black Lives Matter.""

""And so that's what I was thinking, along those lines. I wasn't thinking along the lines of making light of it or making light of the movement,"" he said.

""My perception of it at the time was that you go on the freeway at 1:30 in the morning, bad things are going to happen and that's what I was looking at,"" he continued. ""Like, 'Well, if you hadn't been on the freeway, you would have been okay.'

Cole-Tindall wrote in her memo that his comments were ""extremely insensitive to the victims of a suspected serious vehicular assault.""

Brown, who has been employed with the department for over 40 years, and the King County Police Officers Guild could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.",['https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/detective-who-appeared-mock-seattle-protesters-hit-car-faces-possible-n1243544'],47.6211,-122.3244

A California man who pleaded guilty to attacking anti-racism protesters at a white nationalist rally and at a torch-lit march through the University of Virginia’s campus will avoid serving a term in federal prison.

U.S. District Judge Norman Moon on Friday sentenced Cole Evan White, 26, of Clayton, California, to 14 months in prison but gave him credit for seven months he served in jail after his arrest and five months of home confinement. That leaves two more months of house arrest followed by two years of supervised release.

White was one of four members or associates of a white supremacist group called Rise Above Movement who were charged with conspiring to riot at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Moon previously sentenced White’s three co-defendants to between two and three years in prison.

A prosecutor said White deserves a more lenient sentence because he immediately cooperated with authorities, disavowed the hateful ideology that led him to participate in the Charlottesville violence and provided substantial assistance in this and a separate investigation.

White said he is ashamed of his actions but used his time in jail to make himself a better person.

“My foolish actions caused me to be confined to a small cell for 23 hours a day, resulting in the loss of many relationships,” he said. “Words cannot express the guilt and embarrassment I have for being part of something so destructive.”

Video footage captured White head-butting a clergyman and a woman, bloodying her face, during the confrontations between far-right extremists and counterprotesters on the streets of Charlottesville, according to an FBI task force member’s affidavit. The violence culminated with an avowed neo-Nazi, James Fields, deliberately ramming his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a woman.

As part of his guilty plea, White admitted that he struck people with a torch during the march through the University of Virginia’s campus on the night before the rally. Torch-bearers chanted anti-Semitic slogans, such as “Jews will not replace us!” before surrounding and attacking students and other counterprotesters.

White also acknowledged that he joined members of the now-defunct Rise Above Movement at an April 2017 political rally on the streets of downtown Berkeley, California, where he punched protesters in the head. White befriended one of the group’s members at the Berkeley rally. Members of the California-based Rise Above Movement, or “RAM” for short, frequently posted photographs and videos of themselves engaging in mixed martial arts street-fighting techniques.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Kavanaugh recommended a prison sentence ranging from 12 to 18 months but said prosecutors aren’t opposed to letting White complete his sentence on community confinement or home detention since he already was incarcerated for more than seven months.

“He fully and entirely accepted responsibility,” Kavanaugh said.

Kavanaugh said White had agreed to testify against his co-defendants as well as a Florida man who was charged separately with waging an online campaign to terrorize and harass those who opposed his white supremacist ideology. Daniel McMahon, 32, of Brandon, Florida , pleaded guilty in April to using social media to threaten a Black activist to deter the man from running for office in Charlottesville and was sentenced in August to three years and five months in prison.

Kavanaugh said White could have helped prosecutors prove that McMahon’s call for using a “diversity of tactics” against the Black activist, Don Gathers, was a euphemism for violence. “Cole White was familiar with the ideology that was used by white supremacists and people online and knew the context surrounding that phrase,” the prosecutor said.

Last week, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reconsider an appeal by two of White’s co-defendants. A three-judge panel rejected the two men’s arguments that the Anti-Riot Act, the law they pleaded guilty to violating, is unconstitutionally vague under the First Amendment’s free speech clause.

Benjamin Daley, 27, of Torrance, California, was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Thomas Gillen, 26, of Redondo Beach, California, received a sentence of 33 months. Michael Miselis, 31, of Lawndale, California, was sentenced to 27 months.

Miselis was released from federal custody on Sept. 2, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Gillen is due to be released in February 2021. Daley is scheduled for release in May 2021.

White has attended San Francisco State University since a federal magistrate agreed to free him from jail in May 2019, according to defense attorney Michael Hemenway. White was detained for more than seven months between his October 2018 arrest and his release on $10,000 bond.

University spokesman Kent Bravo said in an email Monday that White is a part-time student who first enrolled in the fall 2017 semester, which started less than a month after the Charlottesville rally. Bravo said the admissions process for San Francisco State and other schools in the California State University system does not ask applicants about their criminal background.

“San Francisco State University unequivocally condemns white supremacy,” Bravo said in a statement. “We send our compassion and concern to those affected by the events of that tragic weekend, specifically the victims and families of those who were targeted by individuals motivated by hate.”",['https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-virginia-california-charlottesville-prisons-ff272864758dff4c10b3656d06d3a539'],37.8723,-122.27600000000001
